**HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY**

1. Create your own branch to work on.
2. make and commit changes.
3. Push changes you make to your branch.
4. When you think your branch should be merged into `master`, open a pull request and talk to the [programming lead.](https://github.com/tkdberger)
5. ???
6. Profit

Never, ever, ***EVER*** push a commit directly to master. 

***EVER.*** 

The only commits on master should be merge commits from pull requests. This (helps) prevent conflicts.
